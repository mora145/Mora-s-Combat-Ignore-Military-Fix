An annoying mistake especially for those of us who do Hardcore Anomaly, with high vision or hearing ranges. Military NPCs shoot you in the Cordon even though Sidorovich is supposed to pay a fee so they don't shoot free stalkers.

Changes this mod makes:
- Fixes a logic error about NPC matches (Free Stalkers vs. Military)
- The distance considered prudent to approach the Military in the cordon is reduced to 10 meters. (If you come closer than that, they will shoot you)
- Once you shoot at the cordon to a military man, he will go into combat mode and will not ignore you unless you move too far away from him.

Notes: 
- If you're from any faction other than free stalkers, they'll ignore this mod. 
- Situations where the NPCs will ignore this mod: seeing bodies of friends/allies with premature time of death, shooting one of the integrandes of the squad, throwing a grenade near the NPC.
